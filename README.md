The **MediaEval Medico 2026 Challenge** focuses on **Visual Question Answering (VQA)** for **Gastrointestinal (GI) imaging**, emphasizing **explainability** to foster **trustworthy AI** for **clinical adoption**.

This task continues the long-running **Medico series** at MediaEval, now leveraging the newly developed **Kvasir-VQA-x1 dataset**, designed to support **multimodal reasoning** and **interpretable clinical decision support**.

## About MediaEval 2026

The Benchmarking Initiative for Multimedia Evaluation (MediaEval) offers challenges related to multimedia analysis, retrieval and exploration. MediaEval tasks involve multiple modalities (e.g., audio, visual, textual, and/or contextual) and focus on the human and social aspects of multimedia. Our larger aim is to promote reproducible research that makes multimedia a positive force for society.

**Signup for MediaEval 2026 is now open** via the [MediaEval 2026 registration form](https://forms.gle/y1mNzrC68eGXRsUp9)

</a>

**Note:** You can only submit work for **Task 1** if you wish to participate.

It is acceptable to use the full test set for training in your final submission to get competitive score. However, we strongly recommend using proper splits for training and clearly reporting in your paper which splits were used for training, and validation.

### Subtask 2: Clinician-Oriented Multimodal Explanations in GI

**Goal:** Move beyond simply predicting an answer (Subtask 1) and generate **rich, multimodal explanations** that are **transparent, understandable, and trustworthy** for clinicians.

Your system should **justify its predictions** using **multiple complementary reasoning forms**—e.g., combining a detailed textual clinical explanation with a visual localization and/or a confidence measure.

**Requirements:**
- **Faithful** to the model's reasoning.
- **Clinically relevant** and medically sound.
- **Useful** for real-world decision-making.

#### Validation set for Subtask 2:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset, Image as HfImage

ds = load_dataset("SimulaMet/Kvasir-VQA-x1")["test"]
val_set_task2 = (
    ds.filter(lambda x: x["complexity"] == 1)
      .shuffle(seed=42)
      .select(range(1500))
      .add_column("val_id", list(range(1500)))
      .remove_columns(["complexity", "answer", "original", "question_class"])
      .cast_column("image", HfImage())
)
```
val_set_task2 is a HuggingFace Dataset containing the columns val_id, img_id, image, and question, where image is Pillow Image for easy access.

#### Submission Format

A JSONL file where each entry corresponds to one test case:

```json
{
  "val_id": "index of validation subset for subtask 2, as in val_set_task2",
  "img_id": "UNIQUE_IMAGE_IDENTIFIER",
  "question": "Original question posed to the model.",
  "answer": "Prediction from your model from Subtask 1.",
  "textual_explanation": "Detailed narrative in clinical language justifying the answer.",
  "visual_explanation": [{
    "type": "heatmap | segmentation_mask | bounding_box | etc.",
    "data": "path/to/visual.png | [[x1,y1,x2,y2]]",
    "description": "(Optional) Highlights the region of interest that supports the answer (e.g., bounding box around the polyp, or heatmap showing focus on mucosal irregularity)."
  }],
  "confidence_score": 0.92
}
```

**Field-by-Field Requirements:**
- **`img_id` / `question` / `answer`** - Must match Subtask 1 data and predictions exactly.
- **`textual_explanation`** (Mandatory) - Clinician-oriented reasoning referencing visual cues (location, morphology, color, size, vascular pattern, etc.).
- **`visual_explanation`** (Optional but encouraged) - Heatmaps, segmentation masks, or bounding boxes linked to the textual explanation.
- **`confidence_score`** (Optional but encouraged) - Float in [0, 1], from model confidence or uncertainty estimation.


#### Suggested Approaches
1. **VLM Self-Probing for Explanations** - Ask auxiliary questions (e.g., *"What is the abnormality?"*, *"Where is it located?"*, *"Describe its morphology"*) and combine answers into the `textual_explanation`.
2. **Visual Grounding** - Generate **heatmaps** or attention maps showing influential regions and link them to textual descriptions.
3. **Segmentation / Detection** - Produce masks or bounding boxes highlighting relevant pathology, reinforcing clinician trust.

**Note: Participation in Subtask 2 requires completion of Subtask 1.**

## Submission System

> Please do not hesitate to contact us if you encounter any issues.

[View Registered Submissions](TBD)

We use the [`medvqa`](https://pypi.org/project/medvqa/) Python package to **validate and submit** models to the official system.
### Install
```bash
pip install -U medvqa
```
Always use the latest version.

The model that needs to be submitted is expected to be in a HuggingFace repository. Your HuggingFace repo **must include** a standalone script named:
- [submission_task1.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SushantGautam/MedVQA/refs/heads/main/medvqa/submission_samples/medico-2026/submission_task1.py) for task 1.
- [submission_task2.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SushantGautam/MedVQA/refs/heads/main/medvqa/submission_samples/medico-2026/submission_task2.py) for task 2.

### Instructions for Participants

Use the provided **template script**, and make sure to:  
- Modify all `TODO` sections  
- Add required information (e.g., model path, inference logic, preprocessing steps) directly in the script  
- Keep the required input/output format unchanged  

### Task 1: Script Variants & Naming Requirements

You have two template options for the Task 1 inference script:

- **MS-Swift version**: [submission_task1_swift.py](https://github.com/SushantGautam/MedVQA/blob/main/medvqa/submission_samples/medico-2026/submission_task1_swift.py)
- **PyTorch version**: [submission_task1.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SushantGautam/MedVQA/refs/heads/main/medvqa/submission_samples/medico-2026/submission_task1.py)

Both scripts already include **template example code** for model loading and inference.

**Important**: Even if you use the MS-Swift template, your final script in the repository **must still be named** `submission_task1.py`.

### Task 2: What to Submit (Repository Layout)
Host your submission in a **Hugging Face model repository** containing:
- `submission_task2.jsonl` — one object per `val_id`  
- `visuals/` — optional folder with any referenced visual artifacts (heatmaps, masks, boxes as JSON, etc.)
- `submission_task2.py` file with you team details
- A short `README.md` explaining how you created the explanations and any post-processing you want to share

**Demo submission repo:**
https://huggingface.co/SushantGautam/Medico2026_subtask2_demo_submission/tree/main

**Naming tips**
- Keep `data` paths in `visual_explanation` **relative** to repo root (e.g., `visuals/1234_heatmap.png`).  
- Ensure every `val_id` in the file corresponds to an item in `val_set_task2`.

### Validate Before Submitting
First make sure your submission script works fine in your working environment and it loads the model correctly from your submission repo and generates outputs in the required format.

```bash
python submission_task1.py
```

Next, you can validate the script to work independently. The .py script should now be in the root of the same HuggingFace repo as your model. You can try this in a new venv:

```bash
medvqa validate --competition=medico-2026 --task=1/2 --repo_id=<your_repo_id>
```
- `--competition`: Set to `medico-2026`
- `--task`: Use `1` for Task 1 or `2` for Task 2
- `--repo_id`: Your **HuggingFace model repo ID** (e.g., [SushantGautam/Florence-2-vqa-demo](https://huggingface.co/SushantGautam/Florence-2-vqa-demo))

#### Additional Dependencies
If your code requires extra packages, you must include a `requirements.txt` in the **root of the repo**. The system will install these automatically during validation/submission.
Else you will get package missing errors.

### Submit
If validation is okey, you can just run:

```bash
medvqa validate_and_submit --competition=medico-2026 --task=1/2 --repo_id=<your_repo_id>
```
This will make a submission and your username, along with the task and time, should be visible on the leaderboard for it to be considered officially submitted.
The submission library will make your Hugging Face repository public but gated, granting the organizers access to your repo.
It must remain unchanged at least until the results of the competition are announced. However, you are free to make your model fully public (non-gated). 
If you encounter any issues with submission, **don’t hesitate to contact us**.
